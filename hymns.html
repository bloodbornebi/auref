				This is a working site that contains my work for WindClan hymns.
				It works similarly to my meta guide homepage, where clicking filters on the left will reveal certain hymns, or highlight certain lines.
				For example, clicking a button that said, "Deadfoot" would highlight all "Deadfoot" lines in his color.
				You can have as many or as few character highlights open as you'd like.
			</p>
			<p>
				Like my meta refernce guide, this is a working document.
				As I continue to add hymns, as well as actually add them here, this page will expand.
				I encourage you to think of it not as a final say, then, but as ideas.
			</p>
			<p>
				While I usually allow use of my work without credit, I do expect anything that takes quotes directly from this will provide credit.
				That can be in the form of linking to this page, my tumblr, or my AO3, but you must include credit somewhere.
				I would <em>appreciate</em> if you also sent me a link, but that is not required.
